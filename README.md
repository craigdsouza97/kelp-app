Description:
You are supposed to implement the User story provided below by creating an angular Single-page
Application.

• As a user, I can view the dashboard page which has links to the search page and history so that I can
navigate around the app

• As a user, I can use the search page to search for GitHub users so that I can see their public profile

• As a user, I can view the history page which has a list of my past searches so that I can see the
successful and unsuccessful searches I've done

• As a user, I can view a user's public profile from the search results or history page so I can see more
information about the user

• As a user, I can clear a past search so that it doesn’t clutter my history
